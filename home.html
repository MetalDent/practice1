Situated on a 20 acre, beautiful and serene campus in Ognaj, (3.5 Kms from Gota circle on Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway, Ahmedabad), the lush, green surroundings of the school offer a noise and pollution free, natural learning environment. The school uses state of the art facilities to make learning more interactive and fun and has all modern provisions and infrastructure to facilitate quality education.</p>

	<p>School follows the ideology of providing individual attention to each child and with this in view class sizes are limited to 20 students in Pre-primary and 26 students class 1 onwards. This facilitates effective learning, assessment and feedback. The school plays mentor, facilitator, motivator and guide for the students rather than just giving instructional inputs. Innovative methods, effective teaching aids and activities that cater to the needs of each student are built into the lesson plan to make the learning process a fruitful one. Our continuous and stress free assessment process ensures that the students have understood the concepts. Remedial classes are provided to those who work at a slower pace than the others.</p>
